# For authors of this plugin from the Capacitor core team

This is a welcome message to all new plugin authors in the Capacitor Community organization. After reading and acting on this feel free to delete it from the repo.

First of all, welcome! We look forward to having your awesome plugin and contributions in this organization and are available for help if need be (easiest way is to ping one of us on Twitter).

## Registring with the Capacitor team

Before following any of the steps below, make sure you have been granted access to the `capacitor-community` GitHub org and `@capacitor-community` npm scope.

## Project Setup

One of the goals of the Capacitor Community initiative is to have a set of github repos that follow a set of conventions around READMES, package naming

### Getting Started

When starting a new repo in the `capacitor-community` org, make sure to select using the `capacitor-community/.github` template repo for your new project. This will pre-populate your project with a set of ready to go housekeeping items.

### License

We _strongly_ encourage your project use the MIT license. Apache 2 is also acceptable. Any other license must be approved with the Capacitor core team in advance to avoid licensing surprises.

Your next step after creating the project should be to update the `LICENSE` file and fill in the correct year and copyright holder information.

### README format

### Package Naming

Packages should be named as simply as possible, without any `capacitor` or `plugin` words in the package name itself. Packages must be published in the `@capacitor-community` npm scope.

For example, a Google Maps plugin would be published under `@capacitor-community/google-maps`.

### Publishing

Projects should use the `np` package for publishing which will correctly update tags and manage the entire publish process.

### Changelogs

Projects should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) process (more info soon)

### Recognizing Contributors

Recognizing contributors is important. Every project in the `capacitor-community` GitHub org is automatically set up to use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) and maintainers should recognize any community members that contribute by following the [All Contributors usage guide](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).

### Code Formatting

Capacitor uses a slightly less conventional code style for iOS and Android. The main differences are using two spaces and curly braces opening on the same line. Please adjust your editor settings or use a code formatter. In the future we will distribute a prettier config to make this easier.

### Where to get help

While the Capacitor Community organization is a community-driven environment, it is facilitated by the core Capacitor team at Ionic. If you are ever in need of help, don't hesitate to tweet at one of us or send us an email, especially to Max (Ionic CEO): [@maxlynch on Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxlynch).
